a social media like app for people who like to read and study research papers. users will be able to form study groups
and follow other users; the idea is that the user will have a feed that shows what his or her followers are reading.

so far users can register and make an account, login, browse through a listing of papers, and a few other things.
basic recommendation ssystem based on tags is also implemented. The following system is implemented.

I still need to implement chat functionality, the actual functionality for forming study groups; each study group will be able to chat.
