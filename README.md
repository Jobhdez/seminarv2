a social media like app with builtin computer algebra for people who like to read and study research papers. users will be able to form study groups
and follow other users; the idea is that they will have a feed that is relevant to the papers they are studying.

so far users can register and make an account, login, browse through a listing of papers, some basic computer algebra functionality, and a few other things.
basic recommendation ssystem based on tags is also implemented.

I still need to implement chat functionality, the actual functionality for forming study groups; each study group will be able to chat.
