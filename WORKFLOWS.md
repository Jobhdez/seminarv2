Alice
Alice is a deep learning engineer and likes to study research papers. She likes to go to meetups with other people who are interested in deep learning as well. She often suggests making a study group and studying research papers with others. She goes on my site and learns that my site is tailored for people like her. She likes it because she can follow other like minded individuals and get exposed to the papers her friends are reading. Why is she on the app? She's on the app because she hears my site is a social media site for people who like to read research papers. She wants to go on a site where she can learn what papers others are liking including her friends

Aliceâ€™s workflow 
She goes on my website and spends time on my listing of the research papers (based on the subject shes interested) that other users are reading and posted. She likes it because papers are upvoted so she has an idea of which papers are good. Then she logs in (or maybe she does this first) and learns about what her friends are reading because her feed will contain all the research papers her friends liked. The next day she goes to a meetup and since she knows she can collaborate on my website through chat or video chat and so she forms a study group to study papers.
